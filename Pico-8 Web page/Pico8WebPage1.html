    <center class="pixelheight">
      <p> <span style="color:purple"> "Fantasy Consoles"</span> are computer programs
        meant to emulate older PC gaming systems such as the Commodore-64, in the sense
        that they are intentionally limited in quality such as graphics and sound in
        order to achieve a retro feel. Similarly, the developer tools that come with
        Fantasy Consoles are also limited, with the restrictions of Pico-8 being a
        <span style="color:purple"><u>65536</u> character limit</span>, as well as a
        <span style="color:purple"><u>8192</u> "token" limit</span>. These
        limitations are put in place in order to force game developers to push the
        software to its <u>absolute</u> limits while still making a quality product,
        a challenge in and of itself completely outside regular game development. </p>
