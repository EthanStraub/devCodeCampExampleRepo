      <p>In spite of all the limiations placed on developers, many amazing things can be made within Pico-8,
         often times barely scraping below the compression limits in the process. It is a brutal developer
         environment, but one that forces programmers to maximise the productivity of their code by thinking
         efficiently and planning ahead with how all parts of a game work together. Unlike other game development
         applications, Pico-8 stands out by forcing developers to focus almost entirely on their code in order to
         get the best possible results.</p>
