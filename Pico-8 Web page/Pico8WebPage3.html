    <center class="pixelheight">
      <p> To the left and right of this paragraph are Pico-8 cartridges stored in PNG images. This extraordinary
        <br>feat of data compression is one of the core features of Pico-8, accomplished by the fact that there is a
        <br>limited amount of sprites, sounds, and code for the developer to work with. </p>

      <h3> Various limitations placed on the <br>developer environment are listed below. </h3>

      <table class="table">
        <tr> <th>Data Type  </th> <th>Data limit </th> <tr>
        <tr> <td>Characters </td> <td>65536      </td> <tr>
        <tr> <td>Tokens     </td> <td>8192       </td> <tr>
        <tr> <td>PNG size   </td> <td>~16 KB     </td> <tr>
      </table>

      <h3> These limitations are put in place to accomplish a few things. </h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Encourage developers to write their code as efficiently as possible,<br>
          even if it always doesn't result in the most <span style="color:purple">readable</span> code.<br>
          In the case of <span style="color:purple">"Tokens"</span> (variable or function names), they are put in place to<br>
          force developers to write functions that can accomplish the most amount <br>
          of tasks with the least amount of variables or functions as possible.</li>
      <li>Allow for games to be exported into <span style="color:purple">PNG images</span> which can easily<br>
          be shared throughout the internet due to their small size.</li>
      <li>Allow for games to be implemented into <span style="color:purple">HTML5</span> websites with little <br>
          to no performance issues on the user's end.</li>
    </ol>
