      <p> Pico8 is what is referred to as a <span style="color:purple"> "Fantasy Console"</span>. </p>
      <p> <span style="color:purple"> "Fantasy Consoles"</span> are computer programs
        meant to emulate older PC gaming systems such as the Commodore-64, in the sense
        that they are intentionally limited in quality such as graphics and sound in
        order to achieve a retro feel. Similarly, the developer tools that come with
        Fantasy Consoles are also limited, with the restrictions of Pico8 being a 65536
        character limit, as well as a 8192 "token" limit. These limitations are put in place
        in order to force game developers to push the software to its absolute limits while
        still making a quality product, a challenge in and of itself completely outside
        regular game development.
